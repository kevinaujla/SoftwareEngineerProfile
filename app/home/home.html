	<h1>About Me.</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Kevin Aujla, I am a highly driven and motivated individual who is passionate about technology. I received a Bachelors of Science in Managerial Economics from the University of California, Davis but I decided to follow my heart with the love I had for computers and programming as a kid. I spent the past few months studying at MakerSquare, a three month, eleven hours per day, six days a week advanced software engineering immersive, where I developed serious JavaScript skills and worked in teams to build production-ready applications in various environments, frameworks, and languages. My passion is to engineer usable software, with a focus on modular architecture and scalable systems.<br><br> Beyond software engineering and my education, I have experience in Finance and Sales. I believe my diverse background coupled with my confidence and positivity allows me to thrive under pressure and any goal orientated environment. Standing at 6’5”, there is no surprise my first love was basketball (YouTube me). The game of basketball is how I learned discipline, what hard work is, what you put in is what you get out and how to work with a team to accomplish a common goal. When I am not working or playing basketball I like to spend time with my family, listen to music, travel and learn more about topics that I am interested in (Entrepreneurship, Start Ups, Investing, Real Estate and Personal Development). To learn more about my skills and experience, please continue to explore this page! I believe I have a lot to offer, and I look forward to potentially working with you!
