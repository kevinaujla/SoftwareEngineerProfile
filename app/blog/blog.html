<h1>What is a Closure?</h1>

<div class="wow fadeIn">
<h3>A closure allows variables in an outer, but not global, scope to be “remembered” even after a function is finished running. They are most often implemented by returning a function within a function, although this is not the only way to implement a closure. For example:</h3>

<h1>What is MVC?</h1>
</div>

<div class="wow fadeIn">
<h3>Simply put, MVC is a method for organizing code to make it scalable. Specifically, here are the three parts of MVC:
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">M</span>odel – The model is essentially the data used to populate the application. For example, logic that is related to a database would be the model component of an MVC app.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">V</span>iew – The view is what the user sees. For example, HTML files that display in a web browser would be the view component of an MVC app.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">C</span>ontroller – The controller is the bridge between the model and the view. It takes input/requests from the user interacting with the view and finds what is needed from the model to serve back to the user.
<br>
<br>
It may help to see a simple example of what MVC looks like in real code. For this example, here is what the three parts of our MVC are going to look like:
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">Model</span>– Our model is going be a “database” that contains a list of customers. To keep this example as simple as possible, our “database” is simply going to be an array of objects.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">View</span> – Our view is going to consist of just a form with an input box and a button that will allow users to search the “database” (our model) for a customer.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bolding">Controller</span> – Our controller is going to handle the search request from the view, search the “database” for the customer requested, and then serve back to the view what the “database”, or model, returns.

<h1>What kind of scope do variables have?</h1>
<h3>Variables can have global or local scope. Variables with global scope can be accessed from anywhere, and variables with local scope can only be accessed from within its context.</h3>
<h3>A variable with global scope is simply defined out in the open. For example:</h3>
<img src="/blog/CodeExamples/global.png" id="examples">
<h3>A variable with local scope is defined within a function and cannot be accessed outside of that function. For example:</h3>
<img src="/blog/CodeExamples/local.png" id="examples">
<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<h3>A variable without the “var” in front of it is automatically global. A nested function can access variables in its parent function, but the parent function cannot access variables in the nested function.</h3>
<h3>Closures allow variables in an outer, but not global, scope to be “remembered.”</h3>
